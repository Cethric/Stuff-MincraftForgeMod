# Stuff-MincraftForgeMod
This is a minecraft forge mod inspired by the RedPower locamotion module,
which allowed large moving structures which could be interacted with.

Currently there is no checks to make sure that the blocks inside the 64x64x64
bounding are actually connected before the move.
Moving east and south are also a little buggy.  There is currently a very high
chance of damage on your worlds.

Please do no redistribute or use as your own work. I take no ownership of the
forge source and take no responsibility for the damage of your world.
